Webhook allows to pull mails and send requests to a callback URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Mail Client

Currently, the only supported mail client is GMail.
You will need the client credentials file, which you should set to the name `client_secret.json` and the `request.token` file.
An example of creating it is described [in this README](cli\gmail\README.md).
Once created, use the [configuration file](#configuration-example) to set the directory where both files are stored.

### Optional Components

Run the project using `make`. Make is typically installed by default on Linux and Mac.

If you do not have it and run on Windows, you can directly install it from [gnuwin32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or via `winget`

```PowerShell
winget install GnuWin32.Make
```

If you want to run the project without Docker, you can install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Configuration Example

Create a file with the name `config.yaml` in directory `config`.
An example of the configuration file is described below.

```yaml
- mailClientConfig: 
    mail: "example@gmail.com" # mail address to be checked
    credentialsPath: "/path/to/client_secrets/file/" # location of the credentials files for the mail client, can also be a location relative to the current directory
  runOnce: false # if set to true, the service will run once and exit, default is false
  intervalBetweenExecutions: 0s # interval between executions of the service, default is 0 seconds
  subjectSelectorRegex: ".*" # regex to match the subject of the mail
  bodySelectorRegexList: # regex to match the body of the mail, if no body is needed do not set this
  - name: "test" # name json attribute in the callback 
    regex: "[a-z]{0,6}" # regex which matches the body, is set as value of the json attribute
  - name: "test2"
    regex: ".*"
  callback:
    url: "https://example.com/callback" # callback url
    method: "POST" # method of the callback, has to be provided as uppercase string
    timeout: 24s # timeout for the callback, default is 24 seconds
    retries: 0 # number of retries for the callback, default is 0
```

## How to use

After you have fulfilled the prerequisites, you can start the service.

### Start

Either via docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

or use `make`

```bash
make
```

## Linting

Project used golangci-lint for linting.

### Installation

See <https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/>

### Execution

Run the linting locally by executing

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```

in the working directory
